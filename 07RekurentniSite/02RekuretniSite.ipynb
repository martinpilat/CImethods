    "# Rekurentní neuronové sítě\n",
    "\n",
    "Většina metod strojového učení předpokládá, že jednotlivé instance jsou nezávislé. Tento předpoklad je velmi často validní a pomáhá m odely zjednodušit, ale někdy se může stát, že potřebuje pracovat s daty, ve kterých nějaké další závislosti jsou, např. v ligvistice pracujeme s texty, které jsou uspořádané poslouplnosti slov a na jejich pořadí záleží, nebo můžeme pracovat s videem, kde jednotlivé obrázky za sebou také nejsou nezávislé. Někdy jde tyto závislosti ignorovat (např. pokud ve videu máme v každém obrázku něco najít), ale obecně to tak být nemusí a klíč ke správné klasifikaci může ležet právě v posloupnosti vstupů.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rekuretní neuronové sítě pracují explicitně s upořádáním dat. Kromě dopředných hran obsahují navíc i zpětné hrany, které předávají informaci do dalšího časového okamžiku (typicky do doby předložení dalšího vzoru).\n",
    "\n",
    "Trénování rekturentních sítí se moc neliší od trénování feed-forwards sítí, jen je potřeba síť tzv. rozbalit v čase, tj. nakopírovat ji přes několik časových kroků s tím, že rekurentní hrany vedou mezi těmito kopiemi a všechny váhy sjou sdílené. Rozvinutá síť neobsahuje žádné cykly a je možné ji trénovat pomocí back-propagation. Tato verze back-propagation se také nazývá back-propagation through time (BPTT).\n",
    "\n",
    "Problém při trénování rekuretních sítí způsobuje to, že se gradienty musí propagovat přes mnoho vrstev v rozvinuté síti (proto se také rekurentní sítě dají považovat za hluboké sítě). To vede k tomu, že gradienty buď konvergují k nule, nebo naopak \"explodují\". To, která varianta nastane závisí na konkrétních hodnotách gradientů, ale např. v síti s jedinou rekurentní hranou dojde ke konvergenci k nule, když je gradient menší než jedna a k explozi, když je větší než jedna. Tedy na jeden z problémů narazíme téměř vždy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM sítě řeší problém mizijícího nebo explodujícího gradientu tím, že nahradí každý neuron novou jednotkou. V ní je rekurentní váha, která je vždy nastavena na jedna. Obrázek jedné jednotky (memory cell) z LSTM sítí je níže (převzato z [1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "![memory cell](memory_cell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "V každé buňce jsou kromě vstupu ještě tři brány -- vstupní, výstupní a zapomínací, ty mají za úkol pracovat s vnitřní pamětí buňky a ovlivňují, co se do ní uloží, případně co se z ní smaže. Zároveň ovlivňují i hodnotu výstupu. Každá z bran se chová jako jeden běžný neuron, tj. spočítá vážený součet vstupů a aplikuje na něj nejlineární funkci. Vnitřní stav buňky se chová jako neuron s dvěma vstupy a lineární aktivací, v zásadě tedy počítá vážený součet svojí předchozí aktivaci a svojí současné aktivace (váhy jsou dané vstupní a zapomínací branou). Výstup celé buňky je potom hodnota vnitřního stavu pronásobená hodnotou výstupní brány, případně se na něj ještě může aplikovat nějaké nelineární funkce."

    "V BRNN jsou dvě skryté vrstvy, obě napojené přímo na vstupy a výstupy. Neurony z jedné skryté vrstvy propagují informaci dopředu v čase (jako u běžné neuronové sítě). Neurony v druhé skryté vrstvě propagují informaci zpět v čase (tj. později předložené vzory mohou ovlivnit výstup u dříve předložených vzorů). Celá síť se zase po rozvinutí v čase dá trénovat pomocí BPTT. \n",
    "\n",
    "Právě propagace informace zpět v čase je na této síti zajímavá. Obecně nemáme k dispozici budoucí pozorování a nemůžeme je využít, ale existují situace (například v lingvistice při určování slovních druhů ve větách), kdy máme současné i budoucí informace najednou (v tomto případě za budoucí informaci považujeme další slova ve větě, větu typicky máme celou). V takových případech je vyžití informace z budoucích stavů prospěšné.\n",

    "NTM rozšiřují myšlenku ukládání stavu z LSTM a přidávají adresovatelnou paměť. Stejně jako Turingovy stroje mají čtecí a zapisovací hlavu. Zajímavé na nich je, že celá práce s hlavami a s pamětí je navržena tak, že ji lze zderivovat a síť učit pomocí back-propagation. Koho by to více zajímalo, nechť se podívá na článek [2]."
